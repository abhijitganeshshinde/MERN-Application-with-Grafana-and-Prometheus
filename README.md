# MERN Application with Grafana and Prometheus

## Objective
The objective of this project is to set up detailed monitoring for a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application using Grafana and Prometheus. The monitoring solution will cover backend, frontend, and database performance metrics, as well as log aggregation and distributed tracing.

## Environment Setup
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Grafana
- Prometheus

### Step 1: MERN Application Setup
1. Clone the travel memory application repository from GitHub.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/UnpredictablePrashant/TravelMemory.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies for both backend and frontend.
    ```
    cd TravelMemory/backend
    npm install
    cd TravelMemoryfrontend
    npm install
    ```

3. Start MongoDB locally.

4. Start the backend server.
    ```
    cd ../backend
    node index.js
    ```

5. Start the frontend server.
    ```
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    ```

6. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 2: Integrate Prometheus
1. Install Prometheus using Docker.

    ```
    docker run -d -p 9090:9090 --name prometheus prom/prometheus
    ```

2. Integrate Prometheus metrics into the Node.js backend by using Prometheus client libraries. Expose custom metrics like API response times, request counts, and error rates.

3. Set up MongoDB monitoring using a MongoDB exporter.

### Step 3: Enhance Grafana Dashboards
1. Install Grafana.

    ```
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name grafana grafana/grafana
    ```

2. Access Grafana in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. Log in with default credentials (admin/admin).

3. Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.

4. Create advanced dashboards in Grafana to display both default and custom metrics from the MERN application. Include detailed visualizations for backend performance, database health, and frontend performance.

### Step 4: Log Aggregation
1. Choose a log aggregation system (e.g., Loki, ELK Stack, Fluentd).

2. Set up the chosen log aggregation system to collect and visualize logs from the MERN application.

3. Create a dashboard in Grafana to explore and analyze logs collected by the log aggregation system.

### Step 5: Implement Distributed Tracing
1. Choose a distributed tracing tool (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin).

2. Set up distributed tracing in the application using the chosen tool.

3. Integrate tracing data into Grafana for a comprehensive view of request flows through the application stack.

### Step 6: Alerting and Anomaly Detection
1. Develop alerting rules in Grafana based on application-specific metrics and log patterns.

2. Explore anomaly detection with Grafana using gathered metrics and logs.

### Step 7: Documentation and Analysis
1. Document the entire setup process, including challenges faced and how they were addressed.

2. Provide an analysis of the application performance and behavior based on collected metrics, logs, and traces.

3. Include screenshots and explanations of Grafana dashboards.

## Conclusion
By following the steps outlined above, you should have successfully set up an monitoring solution for your MERN application using Grafana and Prometheus. This solution provides insights into application performance, logs, and traces, enabling better understanding and management of your application environment.
